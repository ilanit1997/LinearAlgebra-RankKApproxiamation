# RankKApproxiamation

In mathematics, low-rank approximation is a minimization problem, in which the cost function measures the fit between a given matrix (the data) and an approximating matrix (the optimization variable), subject to a constraint that the approximating matrix has reduced rank.

In this script we take a random picture and try to reduce it's rank by taking k principle componenets.
We try differnt K values and evuluate best result.
